# webScraperApp
Basic Web Scraper App for parsing HTML text, using CustomTKInter in Python

I enjoy building small web scraper apps, and I built this out to give myself a way to parse the HTML in a simple, and easy-to-copy manner.

Click on the "Google Web Search" or press G to pre-fill the URL with a Google Query, as this is fairly simple to query.

You can do the same for Wikipedia now with W, and you can press the Enter key anywhere within the app to search. 

You can also now use 1-9 to toggle the search filter switches. Yay new features!
